# Why are there so few commits and all are from the same person?

We had some confusion on how to setup the Replit and development environments based on the Sprint 0-3 description. The assignment makes it seem like we would all be working off of the Replit and everyone works on that, however, after a disucssion in the discord it seems like instead everyone will have a VSCode development local and push their changes. 
We will start on this with Iteration 01.
